# Simple Python Calculator

This repository contains a basic command-line calculator built using Python.
It's a learning project demonstrating fundamental Python concepts.

## Features

Currently, this calculator supports the following operations:
- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/)
- Basic error handling for invalid operation input.

## How to Run

1.  Make sure you have Python installed on your machine (Python 3.x is recommended).
2.  Download or clone this repository to your local machine.
3.  Navigate to the directory containing `cal.py` (or whatever you name it) in your terminal.
4.  Run the script using the command:
    ```bash
    python add.py
    ```
5.  Follow the prompts to enter numbers and choose an operation.

## Learning Journey

This project is part of my learning experience with W3Schools Python tutorials.
Future updates may include:
- Looping for continuous calculations
- Improved error handling (e.g., for non-numeric input)
- More advanced operations
